The Assembler and Emulator code written in C++ language for the SIMPLE assembly language written for the course CS209 - Computer Architecture at IIT Patna.

The tests include two codes add.asm and max.asm written by me, rest being named test1, test2, test3, test4 are the example codes written in the project description
add.asm - Algo for finding the sum of first N natural numbers
max.asm - Algo for finding the maximum number in an array

Note:
I was not able to implement data and SET in this, for data I used the commands like ldc stnl or stl for storing numbers in memory
